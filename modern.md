# **Combative Nature of Society**
## *Looking at Policing Statistics for Black Americans*
Toni Morrison's *Home* documents examples of structural racism during the time period of the Korean War, from loitering and vagrancy laws to the eugenics movement.  In the beginning of the novel, one of Frank Money's main concerns is finding a decent pair of shoes for when he breaks out of the hospital, because if he doesn't he could be arrested again by police.  This can be viewed as society's criminalization of the poor and mentally ill.  Later in the novel, Frank also meets a young boy who lost use of his right arm after being shot by a drive-by cop for playing with a toy gun.  Therefore, we can look at modern datasets of police arrests and killings to see how race is a factor.  Overall, we see that modern statistics also tell a story of a society that even to this day can, at times, be more dangerous for African Americans.  Kepp in mind that sometimes numbers could be misleading.  For example, in 2015 more white people were killed by police than black people if you look solely at body counts.  However, when you adjust for populations size, the rate at which black people are killed by police is nearly twice as likely, meaning it's almost twice as deadly to be a black American in police custody.  For more information, you can visit this [Guardian site](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings) and this [FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/being-arrested-is-nearly-twice-as-deadly-for-african-americans-as-whites/).

# **Challenges Faced by Black Americans Coming of Age**
## *Poverty and Education*
In *I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings*, Maya Angelou faces the struggles of growing up as a black girl.  Some of the major challenges that can make childhood difficult are poverty and accessibility to education.  The U.S. Census Bureau and Department of Commerce provide college enrollment rates across a number of races and ethnicities from 2000-2012.  The U.S. Unification Project also provides data on K-12 enrollment, sate and federal revenues, and performance indicators across different races and ethnicities.

# **Building Black Communities**
## *Housing Statistics*
*The Women of Brewster Place* by Gloria Naylor highlights the housing issues faced by minorities in America.  Mattie struggles to find a home for her and her infant son, from her baby being bitten by a rat at one housing complex, to being turned away from other places solely for being a single mother.  Data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development shows that black children ages 0-17 face significantly higher rates of having severe housing problems and high cost burdens.

# **Power Dynamics Between Men and Women**
## *Analyzing How Americans View Masculinity and Nature vs. Nuture*
A major theme in Zora Neale Hurston's *Their Eyes Were Watching God* is the power dynamics between Janie and her different husbands (especially Joe Starks).  Throughout the novel, we see instances where black women suffer at the hands of men, and there are also discussions on the concept of Nature vs. Nurture.  These type of discuaaions continue today, where some people believe that men just have a more innate ability to perform certain tasks over women (for example [this debate on whether biological differences account for the gender gap in STEM](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-james-damore-fired-tech-gender-gap-science-2017-8)), or vise versa.  Are these differences between men and women, along with power relationships, rooted in nature, or are they nutured through our environment?  We can look to data from the Pew Research Center and FiveThirty Eight's Masculinity survey to attempt to see how Americans view this issue.
