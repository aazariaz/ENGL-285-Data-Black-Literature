# W.E.B. Du Bois Historical Infographics
These charts were prepared by W.E.B. Du Bois for the 1900 World Fair in Paris.  They were hand drawn by Du Bois to display the economic and social progress of African Americans since the end of the civil war and the beginning of emancipation.  All charts can be found in the Library of Congress Archives.

These charts overall paint a picture of African Americans concentrated in the South struggling with poverty, where necessities such as rent and food take up a disproportionate amount of their income, and education is viewed as a luxury.  Black Americans in this time period owned very few acres of land, so it's understandable why the character of Joe in Zora Neale Hurston's novel *Their Eyes Were Watching God* would view it as such a status symbol.  In *I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings* and *Home* you get the sense that much of the black community is in debt and still reliant on rural agriculture as a living, a trend that is also seen in many of Du Bois's other charts.  Yet at the same time, there seems to be a trend of optimism.  In the books, the black communities the characters live in generally support each other and keep a sense of optimism about their future.
