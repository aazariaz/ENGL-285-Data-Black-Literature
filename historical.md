# W.E.B. Du Bois Historical Infographics
These charts were prepared by W.E.B. Du Bois for the 1900 World Fair in Paris.  They were hand drawn by Du Bois to display the economic and social progress of African Americans since the end of the civil war and the beginning of emancipation.  All charts can be found in the Library of Congress Archives.
